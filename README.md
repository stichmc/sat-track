## Technology

### Frontend
React with Typescript was used to build the frontend website. 

### Backend
A Postgres SQL database was used to store satellite information, such as name, id, and position data.
An Express based Rest API was used to interface between the frontend and the database.
API calls were made to n2yo.com to get updated satellite tracking information. 

# Usage
Run `docker compose up` in the root directory!
